    <li>finish skeleton of filters and effects</li>
    <li> add dolls to entities</li>
    <li>scenes automatically display the actor on the left and the targets(s) on the right (if dollstring)</li>
    <li>STRETCH GOAL: automatic system to put the scenario in "TimeTravel" mode which lets you take any scene in the page and prevent it and have things keep going from there (will require scenario keeping a list of datastrings of itself, and the ability to load from scene chosen -1 and keep going (eat a seed tho, so its not guaranteed to go the exact same way)) (big thing is that if something is 'fated' to happen it happens anyways even if you try to undo it. but randomness IS a thing so... </li>
