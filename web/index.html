<div id = "todo">
    <li>render names under birbs</li>
    <li>figure out why bob is not targeting himself exclusively</li>
    <li> add new active pigeons to test intro/outro scenes</li>
    <li>allow list of intro scenes (pick one based on filters, if none, just do first real scene (no looping there))</li>
    <li> scene without owner has black shadows, renders all entities, no names</li>
    <li>scene bgs</li>
    <li>have a random filter like sburbsim does</li>
    <li>don't let have dolls have generic images just yet, wait to see</li>
    <li>KeepIfStringIsSameAsMemory</li>
    <li>concept of prepacks, has list of generators and list of scenes, assigning it to a char makes copies  of them to add to char</li>
    <li>ability to deactivate (no longer targetable) or kill(can't tick, but can be targeted)/revive an entity as an effect</li>
    <li> add dolls to entities, have intro scene that shows entire cast in shadow form, entities have baked in dollstring and currentdollstring. if a scene has an effect  for which string memory to load dollstirng from, use that one, else use currentdollstring (effects for changing currentdollstring and effects for setting tempdollstring)</li>
    <li>ability for action effects to add generators to target/owner (example use case, giving them new reasons to flip out) WILL REQUIRE SERIALIZATION</li>
    <li>scenes automatically display the actor on the left and the targets(s) on the right (if dollstring) ANIMATED BEFORE AND AFTER</li>
    <li>system to set doll prefab things like "smug expression" (does this change default string, or just the string for this scene) would need to have a scripting language for layer names and layer values. some things default, but you can add your own things into memory too (all stored to memory). a character creator for the SBURB scenario would have preset memory slots like GODTIERBODY and GODTIERPalette, as well as grimdark palette etc. can also do things like "current sprite plus these layers with these values" for "look angry rn"</li>
    <li>scenes actually have two canvas's rendered, one before effects and one after, animates between them using css</li>
    <li>scenarios have prepacks associated with them, let you do things like decide what are valid options (scenes, generators, etc all together) for character creators to have. can also add prepacks directly to chars, but thats a higher waste tier (things like adding highschool ai to a sburb game)</li>
    <li>STRETCH GOAL: automatic system to put the scenario in "TimeTravel" mode which lets you take any scene in the page and prevent it and have things keep going from there (will require scenario keeping a list of datastrings of itself, and the ability to load from scene chosen -1 and keep going (eat a seed tho, so its not guaranteed to go the exact same way)) (big thing is that if something is 'fated' to happen it happens anyways even if you try to undo it. but randomness IS a thing so... </li>
