//TODO a prepack consists of a lot of generators (which can include datastrings of scenes or dolls or whatever) and a description and  a list of scenes (that aren't tied to generators)
//TODO it should also have an image that does NOT get serialized. instead it is the datapng the datastring gets saved to on export.
//TODO on import of a prepack it stores the datapng it came with so it can be displayed
