<div id = "todo">
    Next Five Minutes:
    <br>
    <li>have dqon's scene remove existing reaction generators and replace them with a new one</li>

    Next Hour:
    <br>
    <li>also make dqon's scene he give ppl less likely to trigger (i want to see carol again)</li>

    Next Day:
    <br>
    <li>make prepack builder </li>
    <li>make scenario builder (has prepacks, suggested players (or abilitiy to generate random ones based on seed), etc)</li>
    <li>(useful for romance)filters for both target and owner having the same value stored to two given keys (checks both num and string for key)</li>
    <li>make char builder (assign prepacks)</li>
    Major TODO
    <br>
    <li>make  action effects that deactivates/kills/revives a target. (scenarios or whatever can have auto things that kill someone if the hp stat is under 0 or whatever)</li>
    <li>final ui (i.e. load a scenario, tweak its starting conditions, pick a seed (or randomize it), and go) (shareable url with scenario name and seed (iff scenario is included))</li>
    <li>IMPORTANT: how do we wanna handle custom image uploads? if you reuse a bg for a scene you don't wanna attach it PER scene...</li>
    <li>effects for adding scenes/generators etc to target</li>
    <li>serialize to data png (review viking book for how it works) (including images uploaded to scenes/chars)</li>
    <li>builders (scene, scenario, entity, generator, prepack</li>
    <li>prepacks</li>
    <li>doll creator (lamia only) (takes scenario as input, exports it as a prepack bundle setting various dollstrings scenario requires in memory like godtier and dead, etc </li>
    <li>skald and neb commentary during story (triggered by keywords) zoom out to show audience and storyteller</li>
    <li>*realy* want a fake wiki rip (maybe just the hosted paldemics)</li>
    Incidental TODO:<br>
    <li>if cpu usage of animation is high, before adding class, detect if the two canvases have the same image data</li>
    <li>peewee scenario for 858 (scenario shoved into image for EVERY paldemic in audio logs)</li>
    <li>scenes actually have two canvas's rendered, one before effects and one after, animates between them using css</li>
    <li>modify doll lib so that each dollset knows if its facing left or right by default, when current doll is changed, reset that variable</li>
    <li>effect for current doll (filter not needed, just check string memory)</li>
    <li>refactor filters/effects to be more consistent before stating to serialize them. what are the bare minimum needed</li>
    <li>ability to specify a string layer name and an int layer number to change in your current dollstring (ignores any layers that don't exist)</li>
    <li>ability to specify a palette (serialized to json, string string pairs) to replace your palette with (if it doesn't have all your colors it only replaces some)(ignores any colors not in your palette)</li>
    <li>palette creator</li>
    <li>scenes load their bg image from their entities memory (useful for things like land background from generators?)</li>

    <li>ability to set temporary doll to render with (then return to normal?) (complicated action effect?)</li>
    <li>once i can serialize scenes, make a full on stand alone DQ0n that turns others into DQ0n as well but if their original name is restored they turn back.</li>
    <li>lamia doll creator (packaged with LOSAS, not just doll lib)</li>
    <li>have a random filter like sburbsim does</li>
    <li>need ways to identify if an entity is the same entity in your memory, such as enenmy, SO whatever</li>
    <li>KeepIfStringIsSameAsMemory</li>
    <li>concept of prepacks, has list of generators and list of scenes, assigning it to a char makes copies  of them to add to char</li>
    <li>ability to deactivate (no longer targetable) or kill(can't tick, but can be targeted)/revive an entity as an effect</li>
    <li>ability for action effects to add generators to target/owner (example use case, giving them new reasons to flip out) WILL REQUIRE SERIALIZATION</li>
    <li>scenarios have prepacks associated with them, let you do things like decide what are valid options (scenes, generators, etc all together) for character creators to have. can also add prepacks directly to chars, but thats a higher waste tier (things like adding highschool ai to a sburb game)</li>
    <br>
    Dubious TODO: Are these a good idea? Or maybe they just aren't fleshed out yet
    <br>
    <li>audio offsets might be harder than i thought, pl says to look into: Media Fragment URI schema</li>
    <li>in builder, output examples of polarity (this will add 2 to a stored value of 4 or whatever)</li>
    <li>series of Decision Points that cause the sim to show the "zoomed out" version, and the player can choose between a few options the Audience throws out</li>
    <li>Consider removing all effects besides SetString and SetNum that don't deal with memory (otherwise i'm doubling everything). use case is setString and then things like AppendStringFromMemory or SetDollFromMemory</li>
    <li>filter/effect for current doll having layer with name X and value Y? (needed to detect god tier etc? or something could target frowners , i dunno, might not be useful)</li>
<li>ability to set x/y position of an entity, have a scene specify you should render them there this scene rather than procedurally</li>
<li>ability to have a scene specify no render before, no render after, or no render either</li>
    <li>filter for current doll having a specific color in their palette?</li>
    <li>don't let have dolls have generic images just yet, wait to see</li>
    <li>system to set doll prefab things like "smug expression" (does this change default string, or just the string for this scene) would need to have a scripting language for layer names and layer values. some things default, but you can add your own things into memory too (all stored to memory). a character creator for the SBURB scenario would have preset memory slots like GODTIERBODY and GODTIERPalette, as well as grimdark palette etc. can also do things like "current sprite plus these layers with these values" for "look angry rn"</li>
    <li>STRETCH GOAL: automatic system to put the scenario in "TimeTravel" mode which lets you take any scene in the page and prevent it and have things keep going from there (will require scenario keeping a list of datastrings of itself, and the ability to load from scene chosen -1 and keep going (eat a seed tho, so its not guaranteed to go the exact same way)) (big thing is that if something is 'fated' to happen it happens anyways even if you try to undo it. but randomness IS a thing so... </li>
